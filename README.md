## üß± System Architecture

The Planify system is divided into several independent microservices:

| Service                   | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **user_service**          | Handles user registration, login, roles, and authentication via Keycloak   |
| **event_manager_service** | Core service for creating, updating, and managing events                   |
| **guest_service**         | Manages guest interactions, RSVPs, and notifications                       |
| **booking_service**       | Handles venue and service bookings, integrates with Stripe and Google Maps |
| **notification_service**  | Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications asynchronously via Kafka         |
| **analytics_service**     | Collects metrics and provides visual dashboards for event analytics        |

Communication between services uses **REST/gRPC** for synchronous calls and **Kafka** for event-driven asynchronous messaging.
